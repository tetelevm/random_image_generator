Healing battles, mighty nations
Holy waters, Milky ways.
The fierce proverbs, the crusades.
Crooked nails, clear eyes
Honorable herbaria, branchy cathedrals
Mountains of the forest, lousy rears.
Binding threads, lingering corridors.
Living beasts, warm lands.
Only combustible laughter, tin enemy, strawberry front
Only earthy salt, wind-up mouse, blue wagon.
Every moment an overdose for all the rest of the time
For all the rest of the time.
Raw nooks, carbonated rivers.
Steel eyelids, formidable zeros.
Tired tantrums, widespread successes.
Dry mouths, seventh heaven.
Side-effects, deplorable grimaces.
Empty masses, loud words.
Insistent conclusions, invisible skeletons.
Colored dreams and something else.
Only earthly salt, winding pain, blue wagon.
Only combustible laughter, strawberry front, tin foe
